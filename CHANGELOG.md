* Updated instructions for Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye.  Many dependencies stopped working, fixed it now. 
* Removed some dependencies that aren't needed anymore! BCM not needed.  WiringPi is deprecated.  LibJpeg doesn't look needed.  
* Replace Inkscape with CairoSVG. Inkscape broke some commandline args, and CairoSVG seems better suited for commandline anyway. 
* Updated Google Calendar instructions, it's simpler for now, until Google break their URLs again.
